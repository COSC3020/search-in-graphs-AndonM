# Search in Graphs

Recall the pseudocode for Depth-First Search:

Given a graph, a start node, and a node we're looking for:
- starting at the start node, while unvisited nodes remain
    - if current vertex $v$ is the node we're looking for, return it
    - mark $v$ as visited
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - recursively process $w$ unless marked visited

Implement the algorithm. You can choose any of the data structures we covered
(adjacency matrix or adjacency list) for the implementation. Your function
should return the list of nodes on the path from the source to the target (not
the list of nodes that you looked at during the search). Start with the template
I provided in `code.js` and test your new function. I have not provided any test
code, but you can base yours on test code from other exercises.

## Runtime Analysis

In the worst case, we must visit all nodes and edges for a time complexity of O(V + E) where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges.
